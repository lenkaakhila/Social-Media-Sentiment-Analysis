## 📌 Problem Statement

In today’s digital world, analyzing public opinion on social media platforms helps businesses and organizations understand customer sentiments, improve services, and monitor brand reputation. This project aims to automate the classification of sentiments expressed in text data.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- NLTK & SpaCy (for NLP)
- Scikit-learn (for ML modeling)
- WordCloud & TextBlob
- Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM

## 🧪 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values
   - Text normalization (lowercasing, removing stopwords, punctuation)

2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Tokenization
   - Lemmatization / stemming
   - Vectorization (TF-IDF / CountVectorizer)

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Word frequency analysis
   - Word clouds for each sentiment category
   - Sentiment distribution

4. **Model Building & Evaluation**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Multinomial Naive Bayes
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1-score

## 💬 Sample Output

- Input: "I love this product! Works like a charm."
- Predicted Sentiment: **Positive**

- Input: "Worst experience ever. Not recommended."
- Predicted Sentiment: **Negative**
